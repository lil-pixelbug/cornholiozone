## Community Guidelines

Rules suck! But you're gonna listen to 'em anywway, fartknocker.

1. **Be Resperctful**: All members must treat each other with respect. Personal attacks, any hatred towards the Beavis and Butt-head franchise and it's characters or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.
   
2. **Stay On Topic**: Discussions should always be related to Beavis and Butt-Head (as in the series, movies, and books). If you would like to talk about Daria separately here that is an option.

3. **No Spam**: Members are forbidden from posting spam. This includes irrelvant posts, poorly made comments/posts that are more ridiculous than our favorite boys (ex: asking how Beavis would react to something), and anything similar.

4. **Creative Sharing**: Members are encouraged to share their fan art, stories, and other creative works. Please make sure that all media is yours and credit others if they were a beta reader, or gave inspiration (even if they aren't on this site).

5. **Feedback**: When providing feedback on others' work, don't be an asshole. If you don't like it, don't say anything. If you DO give criticism or praise it. That is common sense.

6. **Have fun!**: The goal of the Cornholio Zone is to discuss Beavis and Butt-Head. Please, follow the rules above and you'll be fine. Also no NSFW. NSFW works are fine, but no NSFW art. Let your audience know if it contains: smut, rape, extreme violence, or any taboo topics.
