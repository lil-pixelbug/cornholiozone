        <h2>Cornholio Zone</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Cornholio Zone, a dedicated fansite for Beavis and Butt-Head. This site serves as a community space for fans to engage in discussions, share fan works of any kind, and well... be nice or something? Huh-huh-huh.</p>

        <h2>Community Guidelines</h2>
        <p>Rules suck! But you're gonna listen to 'em anyway, fartknocker.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Be Respectful</strong>: All members must treat each other with respect. Personal attacks, any hatred towards the Beavis and Butt-head franchise and its characters or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Stay On Topic</strong>: Discussions should always be related to Beavis and Butt-Head (as in the series, movies, and books). If you would like to talk about Daria separately here that is an option.</li>
            
            <li><strong>No Spam</strong>: Members are forbidden from posting spam. This includes irrelevant posts, poorly made comments/posts that are more ridiculous than our favorite boys (e.g.: asking how Beavis would react to something), and anything similar.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Creative Sharing</strong>: Members are encouraged to share their fan art, stories, and other creative works. Please make sure that all media is yours and credit others if they were a beta reader, or gave inspiration (even if they aren't on this site).</li>
            
            <li><strong>Feedback</strong>: When providing feedback on others' work, don't be an asshole. If you don't like it, don't say anything. If you <strong>do</strong> give criticism or praise it, that is common sense.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Have fun!</strong>: The goal of the Cornholio Zone is to discuss Beavis and Butt-Head. Please, follow the rules above and you'll be fine. Also no NSFW. NSFW works are fine, but no NSFW art. Let your audience know if it contains: smut, rape, extreme violence, or any taboo topics.</li>
        </ol>
